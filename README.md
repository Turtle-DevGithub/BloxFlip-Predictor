https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

# How to use
1. Copy the repository
2. Open the repository in command line (or a terminal)
3. Run the command: "cd ./src/"
4. Run the command: java App.java
5. Paste the round_id into the terminal

After you do this you should see a set of numbers and letters:

[A1][A2][A3][A4][A5]
[B1][B2][B3][B4][B5]
[C1][C2][C3][C4][C5]
[D1][D2][D3][D4][D5]
[E1][E2][E3][E4][E5]

The numbers and letters line up to squares on the bloxflip mine board that don't have mines
This works 75% of the time
